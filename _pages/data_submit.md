## Data submission procedure
<sup>1</sup>HMRS-VERI data sets are accessible from a dedicated page on [MRSHub](https://mrshub.org/datasets/).<br />

Please read the [<sup>1</sup>HMRS-VERI guidelines to submission](/data/) for an explanation of the types and necessary components of the data acceptable for this project. 

Once the dataset itself is prepared, its submission to <sup>1</sup>HMRS-VERI consist of two parts: 
<br />

**1) Your `SUBMISSION.md` Markdown file**<br />
This is a description of your submitted data, including a link to the data set itself, also used by any [MRSHub submission](https://mrshub.org/datasets_contribute/). You can download a template `SUBMISSION.md` [here](/assets/SUBMISSION_DATA.md).

| Developer | Yes | The name(s) you want to credit with development |
| Name of dataset | Yes | The name of the dataset |
| Abstract | Yes | A brief description of the dataset you contribute |
| Type | Yes | The type of data. We recommend to pick one of these: `svs` (single-voxel MRS), `mrsi`, `mm` (macromolecule data), `basis sets` (e.g., metabolite simulations for the pulse sequence used) |
| Format | Yes | The file formats used to store your dataset |
| Sequence | Yes | The MRS sequence(s) used to acquire the dataset |
| Credit | No | Indicate how you would like to be credited for your data - for example, if a certain publication should be cited, or whether you would like to be acknowledged in publications using your data |
| Contact | No | A way you can be contacted, for example an e-mail address, the website of your lab, or your LinkedIn/Researchgate/Google Scholar page. Please note, this information will be made available on MRSHub website, so if you would rather your e-mail not be made public, please don't include |
| Publication | No | A publication you want to associate with the submission |
| URL | Yes/No | A URL to a project page, data repository etc. associated with the submission. The data may be hosted externally by the submitter (click [here](https://mrshub.org/datasets_host_organize/) for MRSHub suggestions on hosting frameworks) or on the dedicated [Open Science Framework (OSF) project for <sup>1</sup>HMRS-VERI](https://osf.io/26btq/). If you choose to host your data on our OSF project, this should include your OSF account name |


**2) A `LICENSE.md` Markdown file**<br />
