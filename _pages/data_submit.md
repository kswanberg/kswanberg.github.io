## Data submission procedure
<sup>1</sup>HMRS-VERI data sets are accessible from a dedicated page on [MRSHub](https://mrshub.org/datasets/).<br />

Please read the [<sup>1</sup>HMRS-VERI guidelines to submission](/data/) for an explanation of the types and necessary components of the data acceptable for this project. 

Once the dataset itself is prepared, its submission to <sup>1</sup>HMRS-VERI consist of two parts: 
<br />

|   1) Your `SUBMISSION.md` Markdown file as also used by any [MRSHub submission](https://mrshub.org/datasets_contribute/). You can download a template `SUBMISSION.md` [here](/assets/SUBMISSION_DATA.md).

| Field | Mandatory? | Description |
| ----  | ---------- | ----------- |
| Developer | Yes | The name(s) you want to credit with development |
| Name of dataset | Yes | The name of the dataset. |
| Abstract | Yes | A brief description of the dataset you contribute. |
| Type | Yes | The type of data. We recommend to pick one of these: `svs` (single-voxel MRS), `mrsi`, `mm` (macromolecule data), `basis sets` (eg LCModel .BASIS files). |
| Format | Yes | The file formats used to store your dataset. |
| Sequence | Yes | The MRS sequence(s) used to acquire the dataset. |
| Credit | No | Indicate how you would like to be credited for your data - for example, if a certain publication should be cited, or whether you would like to be acknowledged in publications using your data. |
| Contact | No | A way you can be contacted, for example an e-mail address, the website of your lab, or your LinkedIn/Researchgate/Google Scholar page. Please note, this information will be made available on MRSHub website, so if you would rather your e-mail not be made public, please don't include. |
| Publication | No | A publication you want to associate with the submission |
| URL | Yes/No | A URL to a project page, data repository etc. associated with the submission. The data may be hosted externally by the submitter (click [here](https://mrshub.org/datasets_host_organize/) for MRSHub suggestions on hosting frameworks) or on the dedicated [Open Science Framework (OSF) project for <sup>1</sup>HMRS-VERI](https://osf.io/26btq/). If you choose to host your data on our OSF project, this should include your OSF account name. |

|   2) A `LICENSE.md` Markdown file detailing your license. As per [MRSHub policy](https://mrshub.org/datasets_contribute/), if this is not provided, we will default to a [BSD 3-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

<br />
Please submit both `SUBMISSION.md` and `LICENSE.md` files as attachments by email (mailto:k.swanberg@columbia.edu) with the subject line "1HMRS-VERI Data Submission." If you choose to host your data on our OSF project instead of externally, please create an account on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) and include your account name in the data URL field of your `SUBMISSION.md` file.
