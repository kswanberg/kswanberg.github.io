This public repository is for sharing spectral datasets that can be used to quantitatively validate proton magnetic resonance spectral processing and quantification tools. The tools to be validated would include not only those that have already persisted in the literature absent centralized validation efforts but also as-yet agreed upon novel software solutions, open-source and otherwise, that might underlie future consensus recommendations regarding precise and accurate spectral processing and quantification pipelines. 

Such data sets include the following types: 
• Acquisitions from phantoms, commercial or in-house, of premeasured metabolite concentrations; 
• Well defined “gold standard” simulations of metabolite spectra, expected macromolecule 
contributions to the baseline, and other features that might be exhibited by in vivo spectral 
datasets, including but not limited to extravoxel lipids, residual water, or lineshape distortions 
from static field inhomogeneity;
• In vivo spectral acquisitions from human or other tissues within the context of experiments that 
also contain supporting measurements of metabolite concentration from non-MRS assays; 
• In vivo acquisitions of signals that do not necessarily include supporting prior knowledge but 
could be useful to include as nuisance parameters for quantification attempts using the 
aforementioned simulated standards. An example might be acquired metabolite-nulled (i.e., 
mostly macromolecule) spectra that can be summed with simulated metabolite resonances to 
provide baseline shapes similar to those that might be seen in vivo.
